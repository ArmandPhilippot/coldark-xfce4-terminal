An optimized theme for web development that comes with two versions: light & dark.

## Presentation

[Coldark](https://github.com/ArmandPhilippot/coldark/) is a gray-blue theme. The colors used respect the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in order to provide sufficient reading comfort.

## Colors

Coldark consists of three color palettes. The first is common to both versions. The other two each apply to a version.

Coldark uses 16 colors for each theme. However, the Coldark version for the XFCE4 terminal only uses 11 colors.

Color adjustment was also necessary on the light theme: `#0b121b` was not suitable, so it was replaced by `#ccd6e4`.
